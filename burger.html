                <p>
                    I am interested in observing the society itself. 
                    I liked wandering around the city by bus on myself in my childhood. 
                    Thus, I also like travelling. 
                    I enjoy making plans on sites I wanted to visit and realized them. 
                    Plus, I adored reading different kinds of maps. 
                    I love how information is represented on the map and the way to decipher them. 
                    I care about weather and climate, simply because I knew how extreme weather would affect our life and how climate change shaped future life on earth. 
                    That is why I believe the methods to mitigate the climate change risks, for example, transferring to renewable energy, are important and efficient.
